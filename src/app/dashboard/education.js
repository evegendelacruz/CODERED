        <View style={styles.contentContainer}>

          <Text style={[styles.text, { fontSize: 10}]}>
            TRALI is an acute complication following blood transfusion that is characterized by severe shortness of breath, often associated with fever and low blood pressure. Although rare, it is one of the most common causes of transfusion-related death. TRALI can occur rapidly after a blood transfusion and is often associated with the receipt of plasma or platelet products.
          </Text>

          <Text style={styles.text3}>
            In order to maintain the safest possible blood supply for our patients, we need to reduce the risk of TRALI in the plasma and platelets we collect.
          </Text>

          <Text style={[styles.text, { fontSize: 10}]}>
            There is no specific test to identify blood products that will cause TRALI in a transfusion recipient. However, we do know that units of plasma or platelets that have caused a TRALI reaction in a transfusion recipient often contain antibodies to human leukocyte antigens (HLA). These antibodies are known as HLA antibodies and are on the white blood cell (leukocyte) surfaces. When women are exposed to their baby’s blood during pregnancy and delivery, they may develop HLA antibodies. There is a direct relationship between pregnancy history and having a positive test for HLA antibodies.
          </Text>

          <Text style={styles.text3}>
            The presence of these HLA antibodies in a healthy individual’s blood does not cause health problems, and generally does not cause harm when transfused to patients. However, in rare cases, HLA antibodies may contribute to a TRALI reaction in a transfusion recipient.
          </Text>

          <Text style={styles.text3}>
            We can reduce the chance that blood products—particularly plasma or platelet products—contain these HLA antibodies, and reduce the risk of a TRALI reaction in transfusion recipients by expanding the screening process for all female donors.
          </Text>

          <Text style={styles.text3}>
            If you are a female donor, we will ask you how many pregnancies you have had. If you are donating apheresis, we will test a sample of your blood for HLA antibodies. This screening will be performed each time the number of pregnancies you have had changes.

            You will not receive any direct benefit from any research. It is possible that the research may benefit commercial interests. Blood components not needed by patients may be provided to institutions for medical or scientific research. You will not be notified as to the use of your blood or donor information when it is used for research.

          <Text style={[styles.text2, {fontSize: 10.5}]}>
            • Research participation will not involve any cost, time, or additional procedures beyond the normal donation process. The risk of the research use of your sample or information is loss of confidentiality. Protections are in place to minimize this risk.

          <Text style={[styles.text2, {fontSize: 10.5, marginBottom: 30}]}>
            • Samples used by researchers are coded. Only authorized Red Cross personnel can link coded samples to a donor’s identifying information.

          <Text style={styles.text}>
            The Red Cross does not share your identifying information with other entities, except as required by law and in limited circumstances
            with research partners who are bound by strict privacy and data protection requirements. An independent committee
            [the Institutional Review Board (IRB)] approves all American Red Cross research using donor samples or information.
            The IRB is government regulated and is established to protect your rights and welfare.

          <Text style={[styles.text2, {fontSize: 10.5, marginBottom: 30}]}>
            • We will notify you in person, by phone, by letter, or electronically about any test results that are identified to you and that may impact your health, and we may invite you to participate in a follow-up study.

        <Text style={styles.subtitle}>What will happen if your sample or information is stored?</Text>
          <Text style={[styles.text2, {fontSize: 10.5}]}>
            • Your donor information, blood, and blood sample may be stored and made available for future research use indefinitely.

        <Text style={styles.subtitle}>What are your rights?</Text>
          <Text style={[styles.text2, {fontSize: 10.5}]}>
            • If you decide that you do not want your donation to be used for research, you will not be able to donate today. It is very important to include blood donors and their donations in possible research studies to continue to provide a safe and effective blood supply.
